# ER-CNN-Keras
Model and facial cropping based on frame (test.py and train.py) are taken from the internet (a code-along).
There is a slight change to the model that I did, data augmentation.
I meant to remove repos.txt but I didn't succeed in my endeavour, all references are listed in the documentation, including github links.
